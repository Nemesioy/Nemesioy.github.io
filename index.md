### CPSC 120

* Lab 5
 
   Lab 5, part 3 was a favorite because it was the first difficult lab we were presented with. It was the first lab where we had to compare actual command line arguments to what we had in our code. Because previously we had done our labs using std::cin, which read in values to the code from our command line. It was also the first to have us learn how to read through the command line arguments using a for loop for the arguments vector. But I think I just enjoyed the complexity of the lab as it made the other labs after it easier to understand, since they all consisted of the same idea.
 
* Lab 10
 
   Lab 10, part 3 was a favorite because we learned how to create an image of color, while a rather uninteresting image, it stepped up the possibilities of what we could do with the knowledge we had up to this point. We learned about the GraphicsMagick library, which allowed us to scale our image, as well as create colors and manipulate them to get the image we obtained after completing the code. Which was a mixture of the red, green, and blue colors. It layed down the foundation for what we would create in lab 12, which were GIF's of color and text. So it was pretty cool to step away from just simple coding of running programs that dealt with text only to ones that created images. 
 
* Lab 12
 
   Lab 12, part 2 was a favorite because it really brought everything from each previous lab into 1. It included variables, if statements, nested for loops, random number generators, mathematical operators, functions, vectors, the GraphicsMagick library etc.. All this to create an animated GIF which could display any short message, like "Hello World". We learned how to use the trigonometric function, sine, in order to fluctuate the color of the pixel in the image for the first part. For the second part, we learned how to use a random number generator in order to choose whether a red, blue or green color would be used to fill in a pixel. And although we only filled in the basics of code, it was pretty neat seeing how we could use loops and functions within the GraphicsMagick library to create a vector of images and have each image represented by a different pixel of color. Definitely one of the more enjoyable but complicated labs.
